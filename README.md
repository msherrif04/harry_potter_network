## Data Preprocessing
Acquired data is not always squeaky clean, so preprocessing them are an integral part of any data analysis. In this section you can talk about the same.

# Code structure
Explain the code structure and how it is organized, including any significant files and their purposes. This will help others understand how to navigate your project and find specific components. 

Here is the basic suggested skeleton for your data science repo (you can structure your repository as needed ):

```bash
├── data
│   ├── data1.csv
│   ├── data2.csv
│   ├── cleanedData
│       ├── cleaneddata1.csv
|       └── cleaneddata2.csv
├── data_acquisition.py
├── data_preprocessing.ipynb
├── data_analysis.ipynb
├── data_modelling.ipynb
├── Img

├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

# Results and evaluation
Provide an overview of the results of your project, including any relevant metrics and graphs. Include explanations of any evaluation methodologies and how they were used to assess the quality of the model. You can also make it appealing by including any pictures of your analysis or visualizations.

# Future work
Outline potential future work that can be done to extend the project or improve its functionality. This will help others understand the scope of your project and identify areas where they can contribute.

# Acknowledgments/References
Acknowledge any contributors, data sources, or other relevant parties who have contributed to the project. This is an excellent way to show your appreciation for those who have helped you along the way.
