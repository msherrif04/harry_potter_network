# Code structure
Explain the code structure and how it is organized, including any significant files and their purposes. This will help others understand how to navigate your project and find specific components. 

Here is the basic suggested skeleton for your data science repo (you can structure your repository as needed ):

# Results and evaluation
## Important Characters
The most important characters were measured by three metrics, degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality. Harry, Ron, Hermoine and Dumbledore were consistently the most important characters across allt he 7 books.
 ### Degree Centrality

### Closeness Centrality

### Betweenness Centrality

# Future work
Our analysis represents only the tip of the iceberg of possibilities for applying data science to deep and meaningful literary analysis.
